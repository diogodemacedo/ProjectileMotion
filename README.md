# ProjectileMotion

This is a very basic 2-D kinematics python script I wrote. It computes an approximate solution of Newton's second law for the motion of a projectile from its initial position until it hits the ground. The output of this program are two plots:  The ballistic curve followed by the launched projectile, i.e keeping track of its position over time. And the speed (magnitude of the velocity) of the projectile as a function of horizontal
distance traveled. 
The variables at the top of the code are the parameters that can be changed as you please, namely the gravitational acceleration, the mass of the projectile, its initial velocity, the launch angle, and the drag constant.
